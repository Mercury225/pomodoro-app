# comments

- i learnt so much! It was my first time drawing the ring counter, which was exciting, and my first time using the forEach function on arrays
- i customised a lot of this using Javascript, which was a challenge in its own
- Had a lot of fun!

# in my next project

- i will stick to a BEM naming convention for my CSS next round
- i will try to group together elements into arrays and use forEach, which saves a lot of coding lines
- i will use more deconstructing and spread operators consistently instead of coding for each individual element

# If you can help

- Please could you suggest cleaner and more efficient code, or any methods that i have used which is cumbersome, looking for the most efficient way to represent my code.
